## Repository structure🌲

### [Fitness-Tracker🏃‍♂️](./fitness_tracker): 
Module for processing data from the "runaway" fitness tracker by Unicorn. Receives data in a format (time, steps), saves it, outputs a summary to the terminal and returns the data for further processing. Includes motivational messages based on distance traveled.

### [Caesars-Cipher🗝️](./caesars_cipher): 
Module encrypts and decrypts English text using a Caesar cipher, adjusting the shift based on word length. It maintains letter case and word boundaries, offering a user-friendly command-line interface with input validation and result saving to ```result.txt```.

## Target🎯
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my academic achievements and develop my skills in programming, data analysis, web development and other areas.
Here I will constantly update and add new projects as they are completed.
