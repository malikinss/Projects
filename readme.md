## Repository structure🌲

### Fitness-Tracker🏃‍♂️: 
Module for processing data from the "runaway" fitness tracker from Unicorn. Receives data in a format (time, steps), saves it, outputs a summary to the terminal and returns the data for further processing. Includes motivational messages based on distance traveled.

## Target🎯
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my academic achievements and develop my skills in programming, data analysis, web development and other areas.
Here I will constantly update and add new projects as they are completed.
